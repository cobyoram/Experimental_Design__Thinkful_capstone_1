    "# Capstone 1\n",
    "## Research Proposal\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "Given my previous experience in the energy domain, I chose to primarily focus on datasets involving electricity transmission, generation, and distribution. I landed on a dataset that reports the power generation by source in MW for every hour in the country of Spain. The dataset was accompanied by a dataset reporting weather patterns in the same region and at the same resolution. The dataset for power generation and for weather data can be found at, respectively: `'https://github.com/cobyoram/Thinkful_capstone_1/blob/master/energy_dataset.csv'` and `'https://github.com/cobyoram/Thinkful_capstone_1/blob/master/weather_features.csv'`. This data is of particular interest to me because my previous experience has revolved for the most part around photovoltaic generation, which I imagine would be interesting to compare to weather data.\n",
    "### Research Design\n",
    "The research question I want to answer with this data is a question I have encountered on the doorstep while selling solar systems to residential clients, and a question I have only been able to estimate the answer to. \n",
    "\n",
    "`ow does weather, and more specifically cloud cover, affect the generating power levels of photovoltaic systems?`\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than providing an explicit answer to that question while on the job, I found myself talking my way around it. Finally using a plethora of data, I intend on answering that question with a statistical test. My hypothesis will be as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "`Ho: There is no difference in the median and variance between solar generation power readings when cloud coverage is high vs when cloud coverage is low.'\n",
    "\n",
    "`Ha: There is a significant difference in the median and variance between solar generation power readings when cloud coverage is high vs when cloud coverage is low.`\n",
    "\n",
    "I will test two groups, one consisting of data that lines up with a cloud coverage percentage that is greater than the median cloud coverage, and one that is less. Between those groups, I will compare (non-parametrically) the difference between the two distributions of solar generation power levels in MW. Given the test results and the p-value, I will determine whether I can reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "### Audience\n",
    "This data is useful for anyone who is looking to build, own, or benefit from a photovoltaic solar system. The result of this research question will allow them to judge whether they should consider weather to cause a difference in their power generation. It will also be useful for advocates of solar to be able to promote systems with reproducible and statistically accurate information about the effectiveness of generation under poor weather conditions.\n"
